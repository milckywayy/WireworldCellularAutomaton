# WireworldCellularAutomaton
Java program developed using Swing, offering a versatile cellular automaton simulator for Wireworld and the Game of Life. The graphical user interface (GUI) empowers users to edit and manipulate the game board, run simulations, generate subsequent generations, export and import saved configurations, and extends its functionality for custom automaton systems through simple class edits. The program integrates a matrix class to facilitate efficient storage and processing of cell states.

## Features:
- Interactive GUI: The Swing-based GUI enables users to interact intuitively with the cellular automaton simulator. Users can edit the board, run simulations, and export/import configurations with ease.
- Wireworld and Game of Life Support: The program supports both the Wireworld and Game of Life cellular automaton systems. The simulation follows the rules and dynamics of each system, offering a versatile experience for users.
- Board Editing: Users can edit the state of individual cells on the board, creating custom configurations and experimenting with various patterns.
- Simulation Control: The "Run" button triggers the simulation, toggling the automaton's animation.
- Next Generation: The "Next Generation" button computes and displays the next iteration of the automaton, allowing users to advance through generations at their own pace.
- Import/Export Configurations: Users can import and export board configurations to/from files, enabling them to save their creations and share them with others.
- Extendable Architecture: The program's modular structure allows easy addition of new automaton systems. By editing classes, new rules and behaviors can be incorporated, providing a platform for creativity.

## Usage:
- Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
- Compile and run the program.
- The GUI will open, displaying the automaton simulator.
- Edit the board configuration by clicking on cells to toggle their state.
- Click the "Run" button to start or pause the simulation animation.
- Use the "Next Generation" button to compute and display the next iteration of the automaton.
- Click "Import" to load a previously saved configuration from a file.
- Click "Export" to save the current configuration to a file.
